// Writing the JavaScript and interacting with the DOM is the main part of the project
// Start small by selecting some elements
// What algorithms do you need to implement?
// Create some functions to store repeatable steps
// You'll need to find a way to track the numbers pressed until the = is pressed
// No need for chaining long calculations yet (see hard mode)
